## Migrating `oid4vci-deployment` to Keycloak 26.7.0

Keycloak **26.7.0** keeps OID4VCI experimental but moves pre-authorized code and the `create-credential-offer` REST endpoint behind dedicated feature flags. The local harness already uses the programmatic `create-credential-offer` protocol endpoint; no credential-request script changes are required for 26.7.

### Checklist

1. **Use Keycloak 26.7.0**  
   The default Docker Compose image tag in `config.yaml` is `26.7.0`. For tarball/`setup`, set `keycloak.version` to `26.7.0` (or rely on `latest` once that resolves to 26.7.x).

2. **Enable pre-authorized code**  
   Set `keycloak.enable_preauth_code: true` so `KEYCLOAK_FEATURES` includes `oid4vc-vci-preauth-code`.

3. **Enable REST credential-offer creation**  
   Set `keycloak.enable_rest_credential_offer: true` so `KEYCLOAK_FEATURES` includes `oid4vc-vci-rest-credential-offer`. Without it, the `create-credential-offer` endpoint is disabled on 26.7+.

4. **Select and grant verifiable credentials to the demo user**
   On 26.7+, issuance requires an explicit per-user VC grant. Set `credentials.enabled` to the credential scopes you want to configure. The `keycloak-ssi config` command grants each selected credential to the demo user automatically.

5. **Recreate Keycloak after flag changes**  
   Restart or recreate the Keycloak container so `KC_FEATURES` picks up the new flags.

### Sample `config.override.yaml`

```yaml
keycloak:
  enable_preauth_code: true
  enable_rest_credential_offer: true
  enable_credential_offer_create: true
```

### Verification

```bash
# From oid4vci-deployment/
keycloak-ssi compose up -d
# Wait until https://localhost:8443 is up
keycloak-ssi config
keycloak-ssi test preauth IdentityCredential
keycloak-ssi test preauth SteuerberaterCredential
keycloak-ssi test preauth KMACredential
```

Confirm container features include the gated flags:

```bash
docker compose exec app printenv KC_FEATURES
# expect: oid4vc-vci,oid4vc-vci-preauth-code,oid4vc-vci-rest-credential-offer
```
